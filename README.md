# Starting Point for Fuel Apps

A starting point for FuelPHP driven apps and websites. 

- HTML5 Boilerplate included from the getgo
- Elegant inheritance structure (controllers inherit from a base class for a particular area of your app ie "Sell_Base", which inherits from a master class "Base") 
- Uses Controller_Template
